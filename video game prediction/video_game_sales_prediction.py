"""From above table, my first insight is I can create bar charts of **console, year**, **category** and **ratings** columns easily. For other columns I might have to go for some other visual representation since the the number of unique values is high.

*   From **SalesInMillions** column we can see that average
sales have been around 2 million and max sales have reached a mark of about 84 million🤩 and min sales were around just 1500😔.
*   From **year** column we can see that data covers sales from the year 1997 to 2019
*   **Critic Points** range from 0.5 to 23.25 while **user points** range from 0.0003 to 2.32. We might need to noramlise this values on same scale else critic points will have higher impact than user points on final prediction although in reality both of them should have equal importance.

# EDA

I am first opting for auto EDA packages like pandas-profiling for generating visualisations and there corresponding reports.
