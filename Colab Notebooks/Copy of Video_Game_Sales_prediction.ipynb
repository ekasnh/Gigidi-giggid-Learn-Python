With the availability of technologies like AR/VR in consumer products like gaming consoles and even smartphones, the gaming sector shows great potential. In this hackathon, you as a data scientist must use your analytical skills to predict the sales of video games depending on given factors. Given are **8 distinguishing factors** that can influence the sales of a video game. Your objective as a data scientist is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales in millions of units for a given game."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o2ClSmpwMflH"},"source":["Project dataset source link: [MachineHack Hackathon](https://machinehack.com/hackathon/video_game_sales_prediction_weekend_hackathon_10/data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AoKouYn5MrOK"},"source":["After registering for the hackathon we receive 3 files viz.
